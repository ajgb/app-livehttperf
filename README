NAME
    App::livehttperf - Real life web performance testing tool

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        livehttperf --help

DESCRIPTION
    livehttperf is a web performance testing tool using recorded sessions
    from LiveHTTP headers Firefox extension
    <http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/>.

INSTALLATION
        cpanm App::livehttperf

HOW TO USE
    This tool is intended to be used to compare how the changes of your web
    application front/back-end impact user experience and the overall
    performance of your web server.

  Create repeatable test scenario
    Therefore you need to create a *typical* user session (browse a bit, add
    products to basket, fill some forms, let some AJAX calls to be
    executed), which you can then replay on the new version of your website.

    I'd recommend Selenium IDE <http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/> to do
    so.

    Remember to manually add *pause* commands if you want to add delays
    between navigating to other pages.

  Record live requests/responses
    Execute Selenium's test case with *LiveHTTP headers* capturing live
    traffic.

    Save to a file which will be used as input file for "livehttperf".

  Prepare web / database server(s) for tests
    Start some system monitoring tool on those servers to measure impact of
    your test.

    Install one (or both) packages:

    *   sysstat

            man sar

    *   procps

            man vmstat

  Prepare your client server
    Disable any processes that could impact the client server performance.

    Use same tools as above to measure the impact of test.

  Execute your tests
        livehttperf --help

    Specify configuration options and run your tests.

    Use LibreOffice Calc to open saved result file (XLSX format).
